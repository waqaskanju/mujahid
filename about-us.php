The institution was initially started as “School”, imparting education from primary up to secondary level. However, a necessity was being felt for an up to the mark private sector intermediate level school, which could appropriately prepare students for their meritorious admissions in professional School. Consequent upon the incessant demands from the public, G H S S was upgraded to intermediate School in 2008.Consequent upon the incessant demands from the public, G H S S was upgraded to intermediate School in 2008Consequent upon the incessant demands from the public, G H S S was upgraded to intermediate School in 2008Consequent upon the incessant demands from the public, G H S S was upgraded to intermediate School in 2008 </p>
